description: <p>In the distant future, when Earth and Mars are on the verge of war,
  the last Earthmen departing the red planet are held up by Martian soldiers searching
  for three saboteurs who destroyed an entire Martian city--an event that will quickly

  "The Minority Report," "Paycheck," "Second Variety" (adapted into the film <em>Screamers</em>)
  and "We Can Remember It For You Wholesale" (adapted into the film <em>Total Recall</em>).</p><p>HarperCollins
